The surgery under general anesthesia with sevoflurane was uneventful, lasting 98 min, during which the patient maintained oxygen saturation readings of 100% on 8 l of oxygen. She has a history of hypertension, osteoporosis, and osteoarthritis of her right knee. Her medications include ramipril, naproxen, ranitidine, and a multivitamin. She appears cyanotic, drowsy, and is oriented only to person. Her temperature is 38.6 °C (101.5 °F), pulse is 135/min, respirations are 36/min, and blood pressure is 155/95 mm Hg. Pulse oximetry on room air shows an oxygen saturation of 81%. There are several scattered petechiae on the anterior chest wall. Laboratory studies show a hemoglobin concentration of 10.5 g/dl, a leukocyte count of 9000/mm3 , a platelet count of 145,000/mm3 , and a creatine kinase of 190 U/l. An ECG shows sinus tachycardia. What is the most likely diagnosis?\\nExample Rationale 1:\\nThe patient had a surgical repair of a displaced femoral neck fracture. The patient has petechiae. The patient has a new oxygen requirement, meaning they are having difficulty with their breathing. This patient most likely has a fat embolism. \\nExample Question 2:\\nA 55-year-old man comes to the emergency department because of a dry cough and severe chest pain beginning that morning. Two months ago, he was diagnosed with inferior wall myocardial infarction and was treated with stent implantation of the right coronary artery. He has a history of hypertension and hypercholesterolemia. His medications include aspirin, clopidogrel, atorvastatin, and enalapril. His temperature is 38.5°C (101.3 °F), pulse is 92/min, respirations are 22/min, and blood pressure is 130/80 mm Hg. Cardiac examination shows a high-pitched scratching sound best heard while sitting upright and during expiration. The remainder of the examination shows no abnormalities. An ECG shows diffuse ST elevations. Serum studies show a troponin I of 0.005 ng/ml (N < 0.01). What is the most likely cause of this patient's symptoms?\\nExample Rationale 2:\\nThis patient is having chest pain. They recently had a heart attack and has new chest pain, suggesting he may have a problem with his heart. The EKG has diffuse ST elevations and he has a scratching murmur.

The surgery under general anesthesia with sevoflurane was uneventful, lasting 98 min, during which the patient maintained oxygen saturation readings of 100% on 8 l of oxygen. She has a history of hypertension, osteoporosis, and osteoarthritis of her right knee. Her medications include ramipril, naproxen, ranitidine, and a multivitamin. She appears cyanotic, drowsy, and is oriented only to person. Her temperature is 38.6 °C (101.5 °F), pulse is 135/min, respirations are 36/min, and blood pressure is 155/95 mm Hg. Pulse oximetry on room air shows an oxygen saturation of 81%. There are several scattered petechiae on the anterior chest wall. Laboratory studies show a hemoglobin concentration of 10.5 g/dl, a leukocyte count of 9000/mm3 , a platelet count of 145,000/mm3 , and a creatine kinase of 190 U/l. An ECG shows sinus tachycardia. What is the most likely diagnosis?\\nExample Rationale 1:\\n The patient recently had large bone surgery making fat emboli a potential cause because the bone marrow was manipulated. Petechiae can form in response to capillary inflammation caused by fat emboli. Fat micro globules cause CNS microcirculation occlusion causing confusion and altered mental status. Fat obstruction in the pulmonary arteries can cause tachycardia and shortness of breath as seen in this patient. This patient most likely has a fat embolism.\\nExample Question 2:\\nA 55-year-old man comes to the emergency department because of a dry cough and severe chest pain beginning that morning. Two months ago, he was diagnosed with inferior wall myocardial infarction and was treated with stent implantation of the right coronary artery. He has a history of hypertension and hypercholesterolemia. His medications include aspirin, clopidogrel, atorvastatin, and enalapril. His temperature is 38.5Â°C (101.3 °F), pulse is 92/min, respirations are 22/min, and blood pressure is 130/80 mm Hg. Cardiac examination shows a high-pitched scratching sound best heard while sitting upright and during expiration. The remainder of the examination shows no abnormalities. An ECG shows diffuse ST elevations. Serum studies show a troponin I of 0.005 ng/ml (N < 0.01). What is the most likely cause of this patient’s symptoms?\\nExample Rationale 2:\\n This patient had a recent myocardial infarction which can cause myocardial inflammation that causes pericarditis and Dressler Syndrome. The diffuse ST elevations and high pitched scratching murmur can be signs of pericardial inflammation as the inflamed pericardium rubs against the pleura as seen with Dressler Syndrome. This patient likely has Dressler Syndrome.\\n\\nQuestion:\\n\" + str(row[\"question\"])\n",
